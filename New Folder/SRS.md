# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Title:** Predictive Health System Based on Biomarker and Regional Trend Analysis  

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a predictive health system that summarizes patient history, analyzes biomarker data (specifically CBC reports), and detects regional disease trends using AI/ML techniques. The goal is to assist clinicians and public health stakeholders with timely and data-driven insights for improved decision-making.

### 1.2 Scope
The system provides three core features:

- Patient Health Record Summary  
- Disease Prediction from CBC Biomarkers  
- Regional Trend Analysis of Disease Prevalence  

Each component functions cohesively to enhance healthcare delivery, especially in low-resource or clinic-based settings.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

- Clinical doctors in small and medium practices  
- Physicians in hospitals  
- Local and national public health authorities  
- Data scientists and engineers in healthcare  
- NGOs and community health workers  

---

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The system is a standalone web-based application capable of functioning in local and cloud environments. It accepts structured or semi-structured health records and CBC data. Modular components allow independent or combined usage.

### 2.2 Product Functions

- Import and visualize structured patient visit data  
- Extract recurring illnesses and medications  
- Analyze CBC biomarkers and detect disease indicators  
- Aggregate regional data and detect trends  
- Display dashboards for doctors and authorities  

### 2.3 Constraints

- Limited access to real-time patient data (simulated during hackathon)  
- System designed for lightweight deployment (low compute)  
- Data privacy ensured using synthetic/de-identified datasets  

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies

- CBC data is assumed to be provided in a standardized tabular format  
- System will initially support only a few diseases (e.g., anemia, diabetes)  
- Internet access may be limited in some deployments; offline functionality is prioritized  
- Open-source libraries and tools will be used to avoid licensing issues

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

- FR1: The system shall accept patient history inputs in CSV or form-based input  
- FR2: The system shall parse CBC test data to identify disease-relevant anomalies  
- FR3: The system shall generate graphical summaries of visits, diagnoses, and medications  
- FR4: The system shall detect regional disease trends from aggregated clinic data  
- FR5: The system shall provide a web-based dashboard for visualization  
- FR6: The system shall allow user roles for clinicians and analysts with appropriate access control  
- FR7: The system shall allow data export for reporting and review  

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR1: System response time for each module < 2 seconds  
- NFR2: UI should be accessible on standard browsers (desktop/tablet)  
- NFR3: Data stored must be encrypted or anonymized  
- NFR4: Modules must be independently deployable  
- NFR5: System should be easy to deploy using containerization (e.g., Docker)  

### 3.3 User Interface Requirements

- UI1: Dashboard should present summary stats, alerts, and patient timelines  
- UI2: Graphs must be interactive with zoom/filter options  
- UI3: Regional maps should visually indicate disease clusters or anomalies

## 4. System Architecture and Tech Stack

### 4.1 System Overview

Modular architecture with three logical components:

- Patient Summary Module  
- Biomarker Analysis Module  
- Regional Trend Module  

Integrated via APIs or shared database.

### 4.2 Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI  
- Frontend: Streamlit (for hackathon MVP)  
- ML Libraries: scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- Database: MongoDB or SQLite (local), PostgreSQL (cloud optional)  
- Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib  
- Deployment: Docker, GitHub  

### 4.3 Data Flow Diagram (Recommended addition for developers)

- Add a simplified data flow diagram in technical documentation:  
  Input → Processing Modules → Output Visualizations  

---

## 5. Innovation

- Uses commonly available CBC reports for predictive insight  
- Detects regional outbreaks using correlation and clustering  
- Summarizes illness/medication trends over time for rapid review  
- Modular design for easy adaptation and expansion  

---

## 6. Feasibility

- All required data types are available or easily simulated  
- Open-source tools ensure no infrastructure cost  
- Lightweight computation enables use on local servers or laptops  
- MVP can be completed within 24 hours for demonstration  

---

## 7. Execution Plan

- Phase 1: Data Setup (prepare mock patient & CBC datasets)  
- Phase 2: Patient Summary (timeline of visits and illnesses)  
- Phase 3: Biomarker Analysis (CBC parsing and disease flagging)  
- Phase 4: Regional Trend Analysis (mock clustering by region)  
- Phase 5: Integration & UI (combine modules into dashboard)  
- Phase 6: Testing & Presentation (demo polish, final output)

## 8. Future Enhancements (Post-Hackathon)

- Support for additional diagnostic test data (e.g., lipid profile, liver function tests)  
- Integration with real-time data sources (e.g., EHR systems, mobile diagnostics)  
- AI-assisted patient triage recommendations  
- Alert system for regional health authorities based on threshold triggers
